About the Exosite Arduino Library
=================================
This library allows you to quickly and easily connect your [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) project to Exosite's Data Platform in the cloud. It connects your project using an Arduino Ethernet shield, Arduino WiFi Shield, or any other networking shield that subclasses the Client class. See the examples folder for both an Ethernet and a WiFi example.

_Note:_ A Murano account and product is required: http://info.exosite.com/platform-sign-up

Tested with Arduino 1.0.5 and 1.5.5

Requirements
============

* Arduino IDE must be installed on your computer [Arduino IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/software)
* Need an internet enabled Arduino system, which is typically done by adding a Ethernet or WiFi.
* Note: Cellular shields typically will not work with this library as is.  They typically require direct AT commands sent to open sockets, send date, etc. The libraries code can be used as reference for what needs to be sent over the modem connection.


Installing
==========
Arduino IDE v1.6.2 or greater
-----------------------------

Newer versions of the Arduino IDE include a Library Manager GUI that you can use to easily install the Exosite library. Simply open the Library Manager:
![image](extras/LibraryManager_1.png) 
 Next, search for and install the Exosite library:
![image](extras/LibraryManager_Exosite.png)
When updates are pushed to this repository, return to this interface if you would like to update the Exosite library to the newer version.

Earlier versions of the Arduino IDE
-----------------------------------

The easiest way to install this library with earlier versions of the Arduino IDE is to simply clone this repo straight to your libraries folder.

```
cd ~/sketchbook/libraries
git clone https://github.com/exosite-garage/arduino_exosite_library.git Exosite
```

If you would rather not use the command line or you don't have git installed, click the download button on the right hand side of this page and choose to open the ZIP. Copy the contained folder to your Arduino IDE's libraries folder (inside your sketchbook folder) and Rename it to "Exosite". If you do not know the location of sketchbook folder click on "File->Preferences" in the IDE and you should see it listed.

Note: You will need to restart the Arduino IDE after installing the library.

Examples
========
This library includes examples, which will be available in the Arduino IDE 'Examples' menu directory.



Interface
=========

Constructor
-----------
```cpp
Exosite(Client *_client);
```

```cpp
Exosite(char *_cik, Client *_client);
```

```cpp
Exosite(String _cik, Client *_client);
```

`_cik`: This is used to hard code the CIK into the device can either be a `char[]` or a `String` type. This parameter can be omitted when using provisioning.

`_client`: This is the interface to what ever network device you're using. Must be a subclass of [`Client`](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/ClientConstructor) such as: [`EthernetClient`](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/EthernetClient), [`WiFiClient`](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/WiFiClient), or [`YunClient`](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/YunClientConstructor).

setDomain
---------

```cpp
void setDomain(const char *domain);
```

`domain`: Custom domain to connect to on next connection. eg. "myprod.m2.exosite.com"

writeRead
---------

```cpp
boolean Exosite::writeRead(char* writeString, char* readString, char** returnString);
```

```cpp
boolean Exosite::writeRead(String writeString, String readString, String &returnString);
```

`writeString`: This sets the values to write to certain datasources. eg. "alias3=value3&alias4=value4"

`readString`: This selects which datasources to read by their alias. eg. "alias1&alias2"

`returnstring`: This is the string returned with the values requested in `readString`. eg. "alias1=value1&alias2=value2"

provision
---------
```cpp
boolean Exosite::provision(char* vendorString, char* modelString, char* snString);
```

`vendorString`: The string that identifies the device vendor name.

`modelString`: The string that identifies the device unique model ID.

`snString`: The string that identifies the device's serial number.

time
---------
```cpp
unsigned long Exosite:time();
```

Returns the current time as a unix timestamp (number of seconds since 1970-01-01) or 0 for error.

begin (ESP8266 Only)
--------------------

```cpp
void Exosite::begin();
```

Must be called before any other library calls, but after `EEPROM.begin()` when using provisioning.

Use only if using the following constructor:
```cpp
Exosite(Client *_client);
```

Migration from V1
=================
Version 2 no longer sets up the ethernet shield for you. In your code you'll need to replace `Exosite exosite(&Ethernet, macData, cikData);` with 

```
class EthernetClient client;
Exosite exosite(cikData, &client);
```
You will also need to remove `exosite.init();` and add `Ethernet.begin(macData);` to your setup() function.
